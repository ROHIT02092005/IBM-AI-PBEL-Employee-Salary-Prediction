# IBM-AI-PBEL-Employee-Salary-Prediction
AI Project to predict employee salaries using machine learning
# 🧠 IBM AI PBEL Project - Employee Salary Prediction  

This repository contains my project submission for the *IBM AI PBEL Course*.  
The project builds a *Machine Learning model* to predict employee salaries based on given features using *Python and Scikit-learn*.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- EmployeSalaryPrediction.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with source code  
- Salary Data.xls → Dataset used for model training and testing  
- README.md → Project documentation  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
- *Language:* Python  
- *Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- *IDE/Environment:* Jupyter Notebook (IBM Watson Studio or local)  
- *Version Control:* GitHub  

---

## 🔬 Project Workflow
1. *Data Preprocessing*  
   - Load dataset (Salary Data.xls)  
   - Handle missing values and data cleaning  
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Visualized salary trends using Matplotlib  
3. *Model Training*  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regression  
4. *Model Evaluation*  
   - Compared performance metrics (R² score, Mean Squared Error)  

---

## 📊 Results
- Achieved *92% accuracy* with Random Forest Regression  
- Salary trends visualized across different features  
- Final model provides reliable predictions
